# BOM V2.1

Mini and Midi V2.1 are using the exact same BOM for the basic hardware parts. The only difference in the required parts is the length of the needed electronics cables, i.e. ring light cable and camera cable.

## Essential BOM V2.1

| Part | Amount | Short Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| M3x8mm SHCS/BHCS | 8+3+4 | Nema17 motors, base cover, imaging unit (IU) |
| M3x40mm+ SHCS/BHCS | 1 | mounting IU to rotor, any M3 equal or longer than 40mm will work, M3x70mm would be perfect, see non-essential BOM |
| Heat Inserts M3x4x5 | 3+1+4 | sometimes called "Voron" inserts for base, rotor, and cam mount. Must be 5mm diameter! 4.6mm diameter will not sit securely. They require a soldering iron to melt them in. |
| M2.5x18mm standoff *female-female* | 4 | standoffs sandwiched between RPi and black shield |
| M2.5x10mm SHCS | 8 | fixating RPi, shield, electronics cover and base cover |
| lubricant | 2-3 ml | lubricant that doesn't dissolve printed parts, i.e., white lithium grease, for cog wheel |

## Non-Essential BOM V2.1 (Luxury and tinkerer upgrades)
| Part | Amount | Short Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| microswitch w or w/o lever | 1 | endstop: standard microswitch found in many 3D printers, quality ones prefered (eg Omron D2FC) |
| M1.6x12 or M2 self-tapping | 2 | endstop: fixating the endstop, screw directly into the plastic |
| Heat Inserts M3x4x5 | 2 | mounting points: for lighting dome mod |
| M3x16mm standoff | 2 | mounting points: will replace two M3x8 from turntable, for lighting dome mod  |
| M3x12mm SHCS/BHCS | 4 | for lighting dome mod, fixating the dome and adapter to the base |
| F692 (2x6x3) mm | 4 | rotor guide: bearing with flange, will guide the rotor, reduce wobble and friction |
| M2x14 SHCS/BHCS | 4 | rotor guide: will fixate the bearings in the base |
| M3x70mm SHCS/BHCS | 1 | mounting IU to the rotor, put a heat insert on the *opposite* side of the rotor, extra stiffness |
| Fan 3010 or 3007 | 1 | motors and drivers are producing heat which can soften PLA (and PETG) over time; a fan helps to prevent that; 3V3, 5V, or 12V |
| M3x14 SHCS/BHCS | 4 | for mounting the fan into the housing |
| M3 nuts | 4 | for mounting the fan into the housing |
